# EE551-Final

My project is to create a Discord (https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) bot that compares data from the three most recent Super Smash Bros video games.  Many Stevens students play these games competitively, and the bot would be able to provide quick information to them if used in the community's Discord server.  

It will take inputs for character and action, then provide data for that combination from each game that the character appears in.  The data will be downloaded from different websites by reading the pages' HTML sources.  This will require python basics (loops, if statements, dictionaries, etc), the Discord API, and likely an imported Python library (to help with web scraping).
